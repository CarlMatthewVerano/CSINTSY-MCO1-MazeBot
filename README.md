# CSINTSY-MCO1-MazeBot


## Maze

The project involves an \(n \times n\) maze, where \(n\) is any number from 3 up to a maximum of 64. A maze configuration is defined in a text file `maze.txt` with a specific format that includes a wall symbol `#`, an empty space symbol `.`, a starting location `S`, and a target location `G`. The maze will always contain exactly one `S` and one `G`.

Example maze definition:

Maze
The setup is an ùëõ √ó ùëõ maze, where ùëõ is any number from 3 up to a maximum of 64. A maze
configuration can be defined as a text file called maze.txt in the following format:

n\
XXX\
XXX
XXX

The first line of the text file contains a single integer ùëõ, the size of the maze. This is a followed by ùëõ
lines containing ùëõ characters each (represented as Xs in the definition above). Each X may be one of
the following:

Symbol Description
'#' - wall
. (period) - an empty space
S - starting location of the bot
G - target location of the bot

You may assume that the maze always contains exactly one S and exactly one G, otherwise it is an
invalid maze.

Here is an example of an actual maze definition:

**The Bot**
Given a maze configuration, you are to implement a bot that must find its way to the goal. The bot
can only step on a space, and its movements are restricted to go one step up, down, left, or right.
The simulation of the search must be illustrated to show which paths were explored before getting to
the goal. The chosen path must be highlighted differently.

**Expected Program Behavior**
You are to implement a program with the following behavior:

‚Ä¢ Once executed, the program loads and displays the maze defined in maze.txt. You‚Äôre free to
choose the way the look of the maze as long as it is easily interpretable. However, don‚Äôt spend
too much time and effort making the maze look good at the expense of the more important
parts of the project.

‚Ä¢ The user can initiate the search. After which, the bot will find a path from the starting point
(S) to the target location (G). The program should display (a) the final path taken by the bot, ,
(b) all the locations that were explored by the implemented algorithm before arriving at the
solution, and (c) the total number of states explored before the solution is found (or not found).
‚Ä¢ The program should also display the order in which the locations were explored by the
algorithm. It is up to you how to want to display this. Some options are:
    o Put a number to show the ordering
    o Use an animation showing the step by step exploration of locations by the algorithm
      (either timed or through a button to advance to the next step).
‚Ä¢ If there is no path to the target location, the program should state that a solution cannot be
found, and must not crash.
